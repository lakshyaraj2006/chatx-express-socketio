# ChatX

I have made this amazing chat app with websockets and expressjs. Complete implementation of socket.io.

You can create your rooms & invite others to join the same room.

**Note:** *The data is not persisted, since no database has been integrated with it. Once closed, all the data will be erased from the temporary array state*
